            <h3 align="center">HOLIDAY IN THE UNITED STATES</h3>

            <p>This Sunday, February 8, is not a holiday in the United States, but it might seem like one to Americans. Many will attend parties to watch Super Bowl LIX. The Super Bowl is the championship game of professional American football.</p>

           <p>The National Football League, or NFL, has 32 teams mainly based in large cities across the U.S.</p>

           <p>The first Super Bowl was played in 1967 in Los Angeles, California. The Green Bay Packers defeated the Kansas City Chiefs. It was not a very exciting game. Many of the seats in the stadium were empty. That changed with the Super Bowl played two years later. People said the public finally accepted the new league when the New York Jets defeated the Baltimore Colts.</p>

          <p>Today, the Super Bowl is a major sporting event. Tens of thousands of people watched the game last year at the Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana.</p>

          <p>Tens of millions of other people around the world will be watching Super Bowl LIX. Of course, fans of American football are excited to watch the strongest teams compete in the biggest game of the year. However, the Super Bowl's popularity goes beyond sports.</p>

          <p>Tickets to the Super Bowl are very expensive — even the cheapest tickets can cost thousands of dollars! Instead, many people throw big parties at home with friends and family. Like most parties, there are lots of food and drinks. Popular foods on Super Bowl Sunday include hamburgers, hot dogs, pizza, potato chips and lots of soft drinks or alcohol. Last year, Americans ate more on Super Bowl Sunday than any other day of the year.</p>

          <p>The Super Bowl isn't just for sports fans; it's for music fans too. Each game begins with someone singing "The Star-Spangled Banner," (America's national anthem). But that's not all! During halftime, a long break in the middle of the game, a famous musician performs for everyone in the stadium and the people watching at home. The Super Bowl Halftime Show is one of the biggest performances in the entertainment industry. Artists like Michael Jackson, The Rolling Stones, Beyoncé, Kendrick Lamar and Lady Gaga have all performed at the Super Bowl. Last year, the rapper Kendrick Lamar played at the show.</p>
